**2017.2.12**: Finish this stereo VO.

**Introduce**ï¼š This is a very simple VO that can only be run on KITTI stereo datasets. It has not yet provided a visualization and an interface to save camera trajectory. This VO is a refactoring of **ORB_SLAM2**. The entire framework and the front-end are modeled after it. In contrast, this VO simplifies the back-end LocalMapping thread and simplifies the neighboring frame relationship of the Covisibility Graph.

# 4. Usage  
## KITTI Dataset
1. Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php
2. Execute the following command. Change KITTIX. yamlby KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change SEQUENCE_NUMBER to 00, 01, 02,.., 11.
